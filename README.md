# Medical-Image-Segmentation-with-PyTorch
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for lung CT image segmentation, built entirely with PyTorch. The model learns to detect and segment tumor regions from medical images.  The project is modular, with clean scripts for data loading, model definition, training, evaluation, and utility functions.
Custom PyTorch Dataset & DataLoader for CT scans and masks
CNN-based encoder-decoder architecture (inspired by UNet)
Training with Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss
Evaluation using Dice Coefficient
Visualization of input image, ground truth mask, and prediction
