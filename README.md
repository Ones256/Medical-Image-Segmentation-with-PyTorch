# Medical-Image-Segmentation-with-PyTorch
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for lung CT image segmentation, built entirely with PyTorch. The model learns to detect and segment tumor regions from medical images.  The project is modular, with clean scripts for data loading, model definition, training, evaluation, and utility functions.
